h1. Installation

* You need Redmine 0.8.5 or above
* Make sure you have the Tinder gem: sudo gem install tinder
* Copy the plugin into Redmine’s /vendor/plugins/, edit /lib/notifier_hook.rb to set your Campfire settings, restart Apache and voilà.

h1. To do

* Create a plugin interface. Right now the campfire authentication is hard-coded in the plugin. Create a plugin controller + view so the user should be able to:
** Set the campfire room parameters (url, login, password)
** Set which project should talk on Campfire
