h1. Installation

* Make sure you have the Tinder gem: sudo gem install tinder
* Copy the plugin into Redmine’s /vendor/plugins/, edit /lib/notifier_hook.rb to set your Campfire settings, restart Apache and voilà.

h1. Gotchas

The 3 following hooks need a few changes which are currently in Redmine’s master core code.
http://github.com/edavis10/redmine/commit/4ba83085072d69451149896002958c6ab479b0c8

* controller_messages_new_after_save
* controller_messages_reply_after_save
* controller_wiki_edit_after_save

These 3 hooks are used to send notifications about forum posts creation and wiki creation/edits.

h1. To do

* Create a plugin interface. Right now the campfire authentication is hard-coded in the plugin. Create a plugin controller + view so the user should be able to:
** Set the campfire room parameters (url, login, password)
** Set which project should talk on Campfire
